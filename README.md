# Arrays and functions

## FUNCTIONS
In this class we learned about arrays and functions in JavaScript.

Remember the difference between declaration and initialization of a variable?
    
```javascript
    let myVariable; // Declaration
    myVariable = 5; // Initialization
```

The same applies to arrays and functions. We can declare them and then initialize them.

## ARRAYS

An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements. Typically these elements are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string. Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.

### Array methods
Check the portal and explore the different methods that can be used with arrays.
We've learned how to add and remove elements from an array using the following methods:

- push()
- pop()
